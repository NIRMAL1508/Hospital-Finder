# Hospital-Finder

“Hospital Finder” was built keeping in mind that the patients are unaware of the disease and where to find an appropriate hospital. It takes a minimum input from the user and then suggests a hospital where they can go. In this project, all we have to do is search for the preferred disease that’s all. All the Hospitals along with the specialty will be shown from the list and then we can see the direction to the hospital on the map.
